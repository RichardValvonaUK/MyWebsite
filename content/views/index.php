			<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
			<p>
				I am Richard Valvona and would like to share my passions and experiences about myself. I am from the UK and like to enjoy new experiences and learning new things. If you want to find out more about me, you can see this on the "About" page. This site is still quite new at the moment and I've been busy sorting out other things so please forgive me that it's lacking in content at the moment.

			<h2>Trip to Bellingham, United States - <i>Sneaky peak</i></h2>
			<p>
				Shortly, I will be putting together a review about my trip to Bellingham in the north-west United States. I am here for a total of nearly two and a half months and have been here for a big chunk of that now. I would like to share with you about my two and a half month trip here in Bellingham. If you're living here, then you may be curious about the differences I've noticed between here in the States and back at home in the UK. I will be totally honest with you too about both the good and the bad points.

			<h2>Dandelions Everywhere</h2>

			What could be more nolstagic than seeing a clump of dandelions in the middle of field with grass which hasn't been cut for weeks?
			</p>
			<p>
			I will always have a little bit of childhood in me. I remember blowing them when I was little and watching the pieces fly in the air and getting carried by the wind. Children are unpredictable. It was always nature's plan to take advantage of this. This is how dandelions spread their seeds to create new ones.

			As an adult, I like to eat the greens of them raw. It is a true fact that <?php echo URLS::absLink('you can eat the whole dandelion', 'http://www.moneycrashers.com/eating-dandelions-health-benefits-leaves-greens-roots-flowers/', null); ?> . I lived in a flat with a communal garden and for a large chunk of the year, these just keep on growing. Pull the leaves off, mow the lawn? They come back. This is a real blessing. The food is natural, completely organic, highly nutritious and doesn't take any work to grow. In this sense, this is real free food.
