			<h1>About me</h1>

			<p>
			My name is Richard and I am originally from the Isle of Wight in the UK. I have always wanted to have some personal presence on the internet in a place that I can truly call my own.
			<!--
			I am a programmer and therefore wanted to seek a real challenge and to create my own site from scratch, including the framework. This way, I have full control over the running of the website and the look and feel.

			From time to time, I do enjoy going travelling and getting an idea of what life might be like in different cultures. Last year, I went to the United States of America for the very first time. I didn't go to the big cities like most people do. Instead, I went to one of the smaller cities on the western side and near to the Canadian border. This city was Bellingham where I stayed for two and a half months. It was an interesting experience and despite speaking the same language, the culture and vibe of the place was quite different compared to back in England. In one respect, it felt rather foriegn yet felt similar to the UK in other areas. Sadly, I had to leave! I have written about some of my experiences there. See "Trip to Bellingham" in the menu.

			As a person, I would describe myself as fairly quiet and somewhat reserved. I really like being in the outdoors with nature. If you see someone sitting with a flask of coffee on a wooden bench or perhaps just somewhere on the ground then there's a chance that it could be me. There is something really enjoyable and freeing about having a hot drink out in the middle of nowhere. Sometimes, I even take a picnic with me.
