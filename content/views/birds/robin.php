<h3>Robin</h3>
Known formally as the European Robin <i>(Lat: Erithacus rubecula; Rus: Зарянка / Малиновка)</i>, or which I simply call a <i>robin</i>.<br/><br/>

Robins are one of my favourite songbirds and are very common all across the UK. I would very much love to have one of them sitting in my hand as I find them rather cute and cuddly. I haven't achieved it yet, but you never know, one day this may happen for real. I'm working on it.

The robin in this photograph was taken somewhere between Fishbourne and Binstead on the Isle of Wight. I can't remember precisely where though but the tarmac with the autumn leaves suggests it's possibly by the Fishbourne Inn, the ring-road part further down which surrounds grass or even right at the bottom where the grass and beach are. Of course, more grass - Aren't we lucky to be in such an unspoilt location!
<br/><br/>
For anyone lucky enough to live in the UK, or even in some of mainland Europe, hearing the sing of a robin is one of my most pleasurable experiences. It always brightens up my day when I hear it singing outside my window or even when out in the country. I don't think other robins will agree though. Singing to them is like screeching!
